# Timer Counter/ Pulse Width Modulation (TC-PWM) Projects

### Abstract

The project contains the implementation of the function of a DAC by using a PWM output and a filter and control the speed of a motor using PWM and the ADC code from ADC lab to read the position of the POT.

### Equipments
- SAM D20 Microcontroller
	- DAC/ADC, PWM, TC Peripherals 
- The Extension Board
	- POT
	- Four Multiplexed Seven Segment LEDs
- H-bridge Motor

### Detailed Description

**PWM**
- In PWM frequency generation mode, for the 8-bit counter, is determined by the Period register; while the Compare/Capture Value registers (CCx) are used to determine the duty cycle of the waveform. This allows for a variable duty cycle and a variable frequency for the 8-bit counter. In a typical application, the content of the CC register is changed to vary the output effective voltage while the frequency of the PWM, once it is set, stays constant. 
- Using the fact described above, the pot output is used to control the duty cycle. The output of the PWM is then fed to the H-bridge motor. If the pot is turned right, the duty cycle increases and the motor runs fast and vice versa.
- The PWM output pass through RC filter formed by the 0.1uF and 10k resistor.
- The following figure shows the motor driver circuit for H-bridge motor.

**TC**
- A sine wave of about 500Hz (+/- 50Hz) was generated using timer counter.

> A sine wave of 505 Hz generated by passing the varying duty cycle through an analog low pass filter

**PWM**
-  In the following images of oscilloscope screen, the yellow signal was passed to the port PA22 of the motor, and the green signal was passed through the port PA23 of the motor. The schematic of the ports of the motor is shown in the description section.
